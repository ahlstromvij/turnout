# Did election fraud claims mobilise Republican voters?

The Republican narrative about stolen elections and widespread voter fraud is well-documented. What's received less attention is what effect that narrative has had on voter behaviour, including in the recent mid-terms.

It's tempting to think that Republican fared less well than they had expected because the narrative backfired, suppressing Republican voter turnout.

This makes sense, if you think of the relevant claims as sincere statements of belief: if I believe that my preferred candidate in fact won but subsequently had the presidency stolen from them, then why bother? The system is rigged.

Having dug into the latest ANES release over the holidays, however, I argue in this piece that the "stop the steal" narrative likely is less about sincere beliefs than partisan cheerleading. Using that data set, I found widespread support for a "stop the steal" narrative among people identifying as Republican, but a surprisingly small effect on turnout. 

There's one exception, though: an electoral fraud narrative seems to have a potentially mobilising effect on Republicans. This should remind us that political messages, even when seemingly part of a single "package", can play many different roles, and as such need careful parsing â€“ especially when we don't agree with them.
